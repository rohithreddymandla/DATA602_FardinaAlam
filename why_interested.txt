Why are interested in taking DATA 602?
The Principles of Data Science (DATA 602) syllabus is well-planned as it provides a strong foundation in the concepts and methodologies essential to becoming a data scientist. The course also covers topics like data ethics which helps handle user data more securely. Also, this course offers more practical skills in data engineering, statistical methods for data analysis and programming to tackle real-world data problems. Moreover, Professor Dr. Fadina Alam obtained her Ph.D. in Computer Science and has done research on deep learning and machine learning in the domain of structural Bioinformatics. I'm very happy to join her course as a student. This course will not only enhance my academic and professional career but also enable me to contribute to the field of Data Science.
